##What Are Addons?
Addons are like apps for your forum. They can be enabled or disabled from your Dashboard. Each one can add one or more features, or modify how an existing feature works. You can tailor your users' experience to the needs of your community by carefully selecting addons.

##Enabling Addons

Enabling an addon immediately makes it active and available. There may be a delay while enabling a new addon for the first time while it makes whatever changes are needed to your database. 

After enabling, some addons will have a "Settings" button that appear next to them in the Addons list. Always visit the Settings page for an addon after enabling it, if it has one, to see if additional setup is required.

##Disabling Addons

Disabling an addon will remove whatever features it added, but it never destroys the data associated with it. For instance, turning off the Polls addon does not delete any Polls that were created, it just hides them until the addon is enabled again.
