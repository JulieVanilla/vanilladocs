## Purpose

The Developers section is primarily targetted at folks using the open source product who have at least a basic understanding of PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Clients of VanillaForums.com should contact support to address technical issues. Our hosted product does not allow direct file access to ensure security and performance, which precludes many instructions in this section.
