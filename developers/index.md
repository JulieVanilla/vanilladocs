## Purpose

The Developers section is primarily targetted at folks using the **open source product** who have at least a basic understanding of PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Clients of VanillaForums.com (cloud) should contact support to address technical issues. Our hosted product does not allow direct file access to ensure security and performance, which precludes many instructions in this section.

## Responsible Disclosure

Find a security issue that requires an immediate patch before knowledge of it is widespread? Or, has a previously unreported exploit been found "in the wild"? Please contact the senior development team directly at dev [at] vanillaforums [dot] com. For all other issues, please use the [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/vanillaforums/vanilla).
