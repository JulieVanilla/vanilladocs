VanillaDocs
===========

## Contributing

If you find any problems in the docs or have a question, open an issue. Please submit edits & additions as pull requests against the appropriate branch.

Once we have sufficient content, we will branch open source release versions. Master branch will reflect vanillaforums.com production.

## Organization

The "Features" folder is for all users of Vanilla Forums but descriptions may include services and features specific to the VanillaForums.com hosted service. 

The "Developers" folder is for all developers implementing their own code solutions for Vanilla Forums but may include descriptions of solutions that are not possible or disallowed on VanillaForums.com hosted service. Clients of VanillaForums.com should consult support or their sales representative for guidance.

The "Workflow" folder is teams collaborating with Vanilla Forums, Inc. on projects and for those curious about our processes.

## Formatting

* We use Jekyll, which you can read more about on their site: http://jekyllrb.com/
* Every doc file must end in ".md" and be formatted in Markdown. 
* Please use H2 (## in Markdown) as your top-level headings in each file. 
* Always use an 'images' folder in the same subfolder as the content referencing it.
