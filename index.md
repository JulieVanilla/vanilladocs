## Vanilla Forums Official Documentation

These are the official docs for Vanilla Forums. You can contribute via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vanillaforums/VanillaDocs/).

Vanilla Forums consists of both an [open source project](http://github.com/vanillaforums.com/vanilla) and a [cloud hosting solution](http://vanillaforums.com). Therefore, the documents are broken into 5 major areas:

* [API](/api) - describes the exclusive API for cloud clients.
* [Developers](/developers) - targetted at open source.
* [Features](/features) - using Vanilla (covers both open source and cloud exclusives).
* [Theming](/theming) - building a Vanilla theme.
* [Workflow](/workflow) - for cloud-based professional services.

### Why go cloud-hosted?

* No installation, upgrades, backups, maintenance, or testing required.
* Very best stability, security, and scaling possible of any forum solution.
* Professional on-call support and services to help and guide you.
* A far better value than self-hosting medium- to enterprise-scale sites.

### Why go open source?

* Community is just getting started or is a hobby.
* Shoestring budget but lots of time to invest.
* Valuing tinkering & creativity over stability & scaling.
* Requiring a major customization that isn't cost-effective in the cloud.

We're confident you won't want to leave our cloud solution once you've tried it, but there is no lock-in. Our cloud solution is fully compatible with our open source code and we provide full data exports on demand.

We offer free, professional imports from self-hosted Vanilla 2 installations whenever your community is [ready to upgrade](http://vanillaforums.com/plans).
