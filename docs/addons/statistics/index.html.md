## How to use Vanilla Statistics

The Vanilla Statistics plugin is a display layer for the data that is sent to our analytics server.  We generate and present you with the statistics in a graphical format for the following:

* Number of page views
* Number of new users
* Number of new discussions
* Number of new comments

Using the tabs at the top, you can view daily or monthly stats. Also by clicking on the coloured boxes below, you can isolate the data to one specific data set, such as number of new discussions.

Vanilla Statistics will also create a rolling table of data on the following:

* Most Active Users
* Most popular discussions discussions

This too can be modified by changing the time period, you select to view.
