## Developers Overview

The Developers section is primarily targeted at folks using the **open source product** who have at least a basic understanding of PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Clients of VanillaForums.com (cloud) should [contact support](http://vanillaforums.com/help) to address technical issues. Our hosted product does not allow direct file access to ensure security and performance, which precludes many instructions in this section.

## Responsible Disclosure

Find a security issue that requires an immediate patch before knowledge of it is widespread? Or, has a previously unreported exploit been found "in the wild"? Please contact the senior development team directly at dev [at] vanillaforums [dot] com. For all other issues, please use the [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/vanillaforums/vanilla).
