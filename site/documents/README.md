# Whoa there, cowboy!

:bangbang: All the stuff you see here is the result of running `grunt build`. Any changes you make to these files will be overridden as soon as the docs are rebuilt. Moreover, everything is minified so making changes would be a royal pain in the buttocks.

If you want to help out, please head back to the `master` branch and submit your pull-requests against it. Thanks!
